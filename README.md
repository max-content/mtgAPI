3/25/23 - while at jyard: 
- added server and client MERN to original project.
- created max branch for not messing with the information that has been shared with February Web Fund cohort.
- To Complete: there is currently a webpack 5 error that is still unresolved in the config-overrides. the polyfill imports are no longer automatically installed when you use create-react-app and it causes issues with compiling. *fix this first.*
- To Complete: finish connecting to socket.io on client side see chatgpt conversation for tutorial and answers to questions. *fix this after*
- To Complete: Gameplay structure and vanilla js refactoring.
